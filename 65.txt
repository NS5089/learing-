Team, we need to test the Tetherfi service discovery and auto scaling on AWS cloud.
For that we need to do below things:

Creating:
- Create scripts to spin up a new ec2 instance
- get the applications from a repo (like svn or s3) into ec2
- install the applications (batch files?)
- configure environment variables
- start the services 

Scaling:
- auto scaling group to maintain at least 2 copies of above server 
- monitor and create new instances whenever needed
- LB
